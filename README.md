# Multi-focus image fusion method based on Laplacian pyramid
The algorithm follows the steps listed below:  
•	Laplacian decomposition of two input images.  
•	The top level of fused pyramid is generated by maximum region information rule.  
•	Other levels are generated by maximum region energy rule.  
•	Fused image is reconstructed by performing inverse transformation to fused Laplacian pyramid.
